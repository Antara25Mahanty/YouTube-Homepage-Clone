# YouTube Homepage Clone

This is a basic clone of the YouTube homepage made using **HTML** and **CSS**. I built this project as part of my ongoing effort to improve my frontend web development skills.
Itâ€™s a simple attempt at recreating the YouTube layout using just HTML and CSS, with no frameworks or JavaScript. The goal was to understand structure, styling, and responsive layouts better through hands-on practice.
